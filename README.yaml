description: |-
  Release workflow for Dockerized application using ECR and deploying on EKS with Helmfile.

introduction: |-
  Use provided [GitHub Actions reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) 
  to implement consistent release workflow for any kind of application that use 
  * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) for developing, shipping, and running,
  * [ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) to store the Docker images
  * [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks) for running application in scale
  * [Helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile) as declarative deploy manifest
